## Bugs

- The website had a bug that when a bigger container showed for example the instructions container, it would make the background messy as in moving out of place and zoom in.
    - So, to fix it I had to make the background image fixed by doing 
    ```ruby
    background-attachment: fixed;
    ```
- The quiz had a bug when entered in a mode and after answering a few questions, if you pressed back button and entered again, the score wouldn't reset.
    - To fix it I had to add
    ```ruby
    document.getElementById("correct-answers-score").innerText = 0;
    ```
     on to ```function selectDifficulty()```, in order to reset it.
- For new users or users that cleared cache and pressed Scoreboard straight away before playing the Quiz. Had a bug which was showing "null - null" in the scoreboard.
  - To avoid that issue I have added an if statement to show an empty scoreboard.
  ```ruby
  if (score.score === null || score.username == "") {
        showScoreList.innerHTML = scoreboard
            .map(score => {
                return `<li class="score-list">${score.username} - ${score.score}</li>`;
            })
            .join("");
    }
  ```
- If User wanted to play the quiz more than once, after first time, the question container was having issues in displaying score area and back button.
  - So to fix this bug I had to add a new ```function resetQuestionContainer()``` to reset the style display of the same ones.
